## APIs related to user login - authRouter

### 1. **POST** /signup

**Purpose**: To register a new user.  
**Thought Process**:

- **POST** is used here because we are creating a new resource (user) in the system.
- Validate the user input (e.g., email, password, username).

- Check for duplicate emails or usernames in the database.
- Store the user data in the database and return a success message with the user details or an error message.

**Edge Cases**:

- Duplicate email or username.
- Weak or insecure passwords.
- Missing required fields.

### 2. **POST** /login

**Purpose**: To log in a user.  
**Thought Process**:

- **POST** is used here because the login process involves authentication, which usually requires creating a session or generating a token for the user.
- Validate the email and password fields.
- Fetch the user from the database by email and check for account validity.
- If the credentials are correct, generate a JWT token for session management.
- Return the generated token and the user's profile details as the response.

**Edge Cases**:

- User already logged out or not logged in.

---

### 4. **PATCH** /forgetPassword

- Validate the email and/or username to ensure the account exists.
- Generate a password reset token and send it to the user via email or SMS.
- Allow the user to reset their password using the token and update the database.
- Return a success message once the password has been changed.

**Edge Cases**:

- Invalid or expired reset tokens.
- User attempts to reset password for a non-existent account.
